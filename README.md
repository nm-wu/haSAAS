## Preliminaries of the installation

To use the program, one has to install the tree tagger
as described in

     https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/TreeTagger/

e.g. in directory ~/src/haSAAS.

Install for English and German assessemnt at least the following
dictionaries

     english-chunker.par.gz
     english.par.gz
     german-chunker.par.gz
     german.par.gz

and the tagging scripts and install-tagger.sh.
You should have now subdirectories "cmd", bin", and "lib".

Set the TAGDIR environment variable e.g. like:

    cd  ~/src/haSAAS
    export TAGDIR=`pwd`

Test the installation e.g. like:

     echo 'Das ist ein Test.' | cmd/tagger-chunker-german
     echo 'Hello world!' | cmd/tree-tagger-english

Under macOS, to run these commands will require setting permissions
to the binary via security settings.

## Python packages

The script "haSAAS.py" imports a couple of Python packages.
In case these are missing in your installation, you should be able to
"pip install" thse.

We developed and tested this program with Python 3.8.

## Test data

The available test data was provided originally by 
by Mohler et.al.

    https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P11-1076.pdf
    https://aclanthology.org/P11-1076/

The .csv file has to contain the columns "id", "question", 
"student_answer", "score_avg".

The file can be loaded via:
   preprocess("resources/testdata/en/*.mohlercsv")

We include for convenience the test data, which contains
the data from several files from the link above merged
into a single .csv file.

## Run the script

To run the script, execute

    python haSAAS.py 

note that the first run will take a while, since it will analyze
162 assessments + 4546 submissions with the tree tagger. Later
runs will be much faster.

You might consider to turn on the "verbose" flag the see more detailed
analysis data.
